Emolib is a Python library that checks against the input text, after having enriched it and structured as a semantic network, against the multilingual [NRC Lexicon](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm). The library is built upon the [Formamentis Networks](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222870) from Stella et al. and the [PyPlutchik library]() (paper [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256503)).

It has already been used for our analysis of the [semantic and emotional frames around COVID-19 vaccines](https://github.com/alfonsosemeraro/vaccines-and-press).
